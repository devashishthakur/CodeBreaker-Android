        \n\n

        \nThere are few hints which will help you to guess those numbers
        \n\n
        \nafter you enter the four numbers and enter <b>GUESS!</b> button, colour of each number will change
        \n
        \neach color  has its different meaning
        \n\n\n
        <b><font color="#3cba3a">GREEN</font></b> - This means you have guessed the right number and it is in its correct place\n\n

        <b><font color="#ef2b42">RED</font></b>   - This means you have guessed the wrong number and this number is not one of the four numbers\n\n

        <b><font color="#5d9ae1">BLUE</font></b>  - This means you have guessed the right number but it is not in its correct place

        \n\n<b>DETAILED TUTORIAL ON HOW TO PLAY</b>

        \n\nSuppose you guessed number <b><font color="#3cba3a">1</font><font color="#ef2b42"> 2  3</font>  <font color="#5d9ae1">4</font></b>\n\n

        1 turns <b>Green</b>\n
        2 and 3 turns <b>Red</b>\n
        4 turns <b>Blue</b>\n

        \nThis means that 1 is at its right place, leave it as it is\n
        \n2 and 3 turns Red, this means 2 and 3 are not one of the four number\n
        \n4 turns Blue, this means 4 is not in its correct position, it could be at 1st , 2nd or 3rd position\n\n
        Then you can try to guess the number again, you have 1 at its right position, you can try to change the position of 4 and replace 2 and 3 with some other number like 5 and 6\n\n
        Suppose you guessed number <b><font color="#3cba3a">1</font>  <font color="#5d9ae1">5</font>  <font color="#3cba3a">4</font>  <font color="#5d9ae1">6</font> </b>
